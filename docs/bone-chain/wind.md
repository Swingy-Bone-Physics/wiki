The wind feature allows you to simulate wind and have bone chains reacting accordingly. 

To use this feature, click on "Use Wind", with any bone from any bone chain selected.

!!! info

    **As of now, only one wind source can be created per armature. It will be used by all the bones that have a positive [Wind Factor value](./parameters.md/#wind-factor).**

Once enabled, an arrow will be displayed in the viewport, representing the direction of the wind and its intensity. It can be hidden and its color and scale can be changed using the corresponding options.

The direction and intensity can be set manually through the vector components, as shown above. You can also have more dynamic wind behavior using [wind curves](../curve/wind.md).
