Each wind vector component (x,y,z) can have its own custom curve.</p> <p>A wind curve has two more parameters than the parameter curve: Amplitude and Period. The amplitude is used to define the highest and lowest value on the Y axis while the period will determine the length in frames that the full curve is equivalent to.</p> <p>For example, consider the curve below:</p> <p></p> <p>It has 3 points, an amplitude of 5 and a period of 120 frames. The \"real\" values for the 3 points are the following:</p> <ul> <li>X = 0 * 120 = 0 /   Y = 1 * 5 = 5</li> <li>X = 0.5 * 120 = 60 /   Y = -1 * 5 = -5</li> <li>X = 1 * 120 = 120 /   Y = 1 * 5 = 5</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The value is first set at 5, decreases until it reaches -5 and goes back to 5. All of this in 120 frames, as defined by the period. If we had set a period of 60 frames, it would have taken half the time to do the exact same. </p> <p>Once the end of the curve is reached, it loops back to the beginning, so if we have a total viewport playback of 240 frames, the above curve will be used twice. The video below showcases this at 24fps, the curve being used on the Wind's X component. We can see the velocity varying between -5 and 5 just as expected.</p>"},{"location":"curve/wind/#using-the-curves","title":"Using the curves","text":"<p>Once you have created a curve, you can have the wind components use it by setting it in the corresponding fields.
